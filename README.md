#Sudoku-Solver
Simple Sudoku solver written in C, just for fun and practice

## Compilation
To use the ncurses library, the gcc compile must have the option `-lncurses` set.

## Usage
The Sudoku itself is hardcoded in the main file.
The waittime for the vizualization can be set via the command line argument, following the compiled file. If no wiattime is provided, a default value is being used.
